- **T**one: Set the voice, style, and personality
- **E**xamples: Give 2-3 specific examples of desired output
- **R**equirements: List technical specs, length, format, etc.

**MASTER Framework Example (Generated $847K in Sales):**
"Mission: Create a high-converting sales email sequence that sells my $2,997 business coaching program to entrepreneurs who've been stuck at $50K/year for 2+ years.

Audience: Male entrepreneurs, 35-50, service-based businesses, frustrated with plateau, tech-savvy, values efficiency, skeptical of 'get rich quick' schemes, wants proven systems.

Situation: They've tried multiple courses, hired coaches before with mixed results, currently working 60+ hours/week, revenue stuck between $40K-$60K annually, knows they need help but worried about another failed investment.

Tone: Confident but not arrogant, empathetic to their struggles, data-driven, no hype or false promises, professional yet conversational, focus on transformation not features.

Examples: 
1. Russell Brunson's style but for service businesses
2. Dan Kennedy's direct response approach but warmer
3. Amy Porterfield's storytelling but for male entrepreneurs

Requirements: 7-email sequence, 300-500 words each, include specific case studies, address top 3 objections (time, money, skepticism), include social proof, clear CTA in each email, mobile-optimized formatting."

**The SCALE Framework (For Complex Business Problems):**
- **S**cenario: Paint the complete picture
- **C**onstraints: List all limitations and requirements
- **A**lternatives: Ask for multiple solutions
- **L**ogic: Request step-by-step reasoning
- **E**valuation: Ask for pros/cons of each option

**SCALE Framework Example:**
"Scenario: I run a $500K/year digital marketing agency with 8 employees. We're losing 2 clients per month due to poor project management and communication. Team is overwhelmed, clients are frustrated, and I'm working 80 hours/week trying to fix everything.

Constraints: $15K budget for solutions, must implement within 60 days, can't hire more than 2 additional people, must integrate with current tools (Slack, Asana, HubSpot), team is resistant to major changes.

Alternatives: Provide 5 different approaches to solve this problem, ranging from quick fixes to complete overhauls.

Logic: For each solution, explain the step-by-step implementation process, timeline, and resource requirements.

Evaluation: Rate each solution on effectiveness (1-10), implementation difficulty (1-10), cost (1-10), and long-term sustainability (1-10). Recommend the best option and explain why."

**ðŸŽ¯ MILLION-DOLLAR BUSINESS VALIDATION SYSTEM:**

**1. The $100K Idea Validator (95% Accuracy Rate):**

**3. The Customer Psychology Decoder:**
"Create hyper-detailed customer personas for [YOUR BUSINESS] using advanced psychological profiling:

- Projected cash flow for 36 months

Rank them by profitability, scalability, and ease of implementation."

**ðŸ’¡ EXPERT-LEVEL STRATEGIES (WORTH $50K+ IN CONSULTING VALUE):**

Instead of: "Help me with marketing"
Use: "You are Gary Vaynerchuk's personal marketing strategist with access to $100M+ in campaign data. My SaaS startup has 1,000 users and $50K MRR. Design a growth strategy to reach $500K MRR in 12 months. Include specific tactics, budget allocation, timeline, and success metrics. Reference successful case studies from similar companies."

3. Harvard Business School professor (academic rigor)
4. Silicon Valley VC (investment potential)
5. Operational excellence expert (execution focus)

For each perspective, provide specific recommendations and explain how they complement or conflict with each other."

**3. The Constraint-Based Innovation:**
"Design a marketing campaign with these constraints: $5,000 budget, 30-day timeline, B2B SaaS target audience, must generate 500 qualified leads, can only use organic channels, team of 2 people. Think creatively within these limitations and provide 3 completely different approaches."

**4. The Scenario Planning Method:**
"Create business scenarios for my company:
- Best case: Everything goes perfectly (probability 10%)
- Most likely: Realistic expectations (probability 60%)
- Worst case: Major challenges occur (probability 30%)

For each scenario, provide specific strategies, resource allocation, and contingency plans. Include leading indicators to identify which scenario is unfolding."

**5. The Competitive Intelligence Hack:**
"Reverse-engineer the success of [COMPETITOR]. Analyze their:
- Content marketing strategy and topics
- Social media engagement patterns
- Email marketing sequences
- Pricing and positioning strategy
- Partnership and distribution channels
- Customer acquisition funnels

Then design a strategy to outperform them in 3 specific areas."
